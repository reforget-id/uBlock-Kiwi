uBlock Origin is **NOT** an "ad blocker": [it is a wide-spectrum blocker](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) -- which happens to be able to function as a mere "ad blocker". The default behavior of uBlock Origin when newly installed is to block ads, trackers and malware sites -- through [_EasyList_](https://easylist.github.io/#easylist), [_EasyPrivacy_](https://easylist.github.io/#easyprivacy), [_Peter Lowe’s ad/tracking/malware servers_](https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/policy.php), [_Online Malicious URL Blocklist_](https://gitlab.com/curben/urlhaus-filter#urlhaus-malicious-url-blocklist), and uBlock Origin's [own filter lists](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/tree/master/filters).
